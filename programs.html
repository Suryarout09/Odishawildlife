 Wild Tiger Conservation Program<br>

Wild Orissa’s Wild Tiger Conservation Program, started in 1997 is based on the spatial distribution of tigers in the forest areas of Orissa, their numbers and density and sex ratio, the potential areas where tigers have a brighter future, the existence of forest contiguity, etc. The question of laying emphasis on Orissa’s lost tigers was always there, keeping in view the fact after the Similipal forests were brought under the Project Tiger fold, tiger numbers there have stabilized, but elsewhere it was a matter of great concern at falling numbers. Based on these factors Wild Orissa had short listed Satkosia-Baisipalli and Sunabeda forests for its interventions for the first phase. The interventions were of the following order: -

Undertaking field visits to the forests

Carrying field surveys for the tiger and other animals

Associating and coordinating with the State Forest Department during tiger census and in steps to conserve the tiger

Briefing the press, media and the common person on the issues of tiger conservation

Apprising elected representatives of the people on tiger conservation in earmarked areas like Satkosia-Baisipalli & Sunabeda

Providing support to the lower rung of the forest staff employed in tiger areas

Interacting with the local people and instill amongst them a desire to protect the tiger and the tiger forests without whose support tiger conservation would not be possible

Studying the forest contiguity for ensuring a viable gene pool for wild tigers/
Wild Elephant Conservation Program

The Wild Elephant Conservation Program <br>
started in the year 2000 has focused on the problem of vanishing elephant corridors, apart from the year round problem of Orissa losing its mature tuskers to poaching. More than 100 adult tuskers have laid down their lives in a short span a few years, and this trend is in urgent need for reversal before it is too late. ‘Wild Orissa’ plans to involve the attention of the planners and policy makers to take the question of elephant habitat while delineating plans for the state. Members have been associating with the state forest department personnel in elephant count exercise in areas like Keonjhar, Chandaka, Ushakothi, etc. and undertaking field visits to assess the elephant habitats and problems which crop up like the Rengali Irrigation Project which has marooned a large population of elephants in Dhenkanal and Cuttack districts. A National Symposium for Conservation of Wild Elephants in Orissa is being organized shortly.
indian Bird Conservation Network Program <br>

Wild Orissa joined the Indian Bird Conservation Network and the Important Bird Areas Program as an organisational partner during 1997. As part of this program the organization has been interacting and advising the concerned agencies on the issue of conservation of birds in the IBAs shortlisted for the state of Orissa. These include Chandaka-Dampara Wildlife Sanctuary, Sunabeda Wildlife Sanctuary, Satkosia Gorge Wildlife Sanctuary, Bhittarkanika Wildlife Sanctuary, Similipal Tiger Reserve, Mangalajodi in Chilika and Nalaban Wildlife Sanctuary in Chilika. These IBA sites have been visited and monitored from various perspectives including on birds. Wild Orissa has been celebrating IBA Days in the state of Orissa from time to time. Various other promotional activities including meetings, workshops, seminars, competitions, etc. have been organised from time to time to elicit intervention suggestions as well as spread the message for the need for conservation. During all these senior level government functionaries apart from the press/media, local communities, children and youth, have taken part. The issues deliberated upon and the suggestions which emanate have been duly communicated to the appropriate forum. The issue of bird conservation has also been addressed by Wild Orissa through its various other programs like Conservation of Waterfowl  Breeding Habitat, Waterfowl Monitoring, Community Participation in Waterfowl Conservation, Wild Birds Conservation, Rescue and Release to the Wilds, etc.
